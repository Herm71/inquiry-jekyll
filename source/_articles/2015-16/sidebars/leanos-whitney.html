<h2>From the Whitney Museum to Los Angeles buses</h2>

<p>As a social art practitioner, Lea&ntilde;os' art and audiences are diverse. Frontera! aired on PBS.org and Latino Public Broadcasting. His public awareness video about the dangers of sugar, flour and salt, called Evil White Foods, played on the Metro Los Angeles bus system and in community clinic waiting rooms.</p>

<p>His films, installation art and performance work have been exhibited at venues including the Sundance Film Festival, the 2002 Whitney Biennial in New York,
the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>In 2009, Lea&ntilde;os premiered a multimedia opera, Imperial Silence: Una Opera Muerta / A Dead Opera in Four Acts. It fuses dark-humored animation with Mexican folklore dance, theater, Mariachi music, hip-hop, bossa nova, and blues.</p>

<p>"Imperial Silence is a performance that journeys to the 'other' side to illuminate cultural taboos around silence, death and dissent--especially in war and empire--in the satirical Mexican and Chicana/o tradition of the Days of the Dead," said Lea&ntilde;os, who is the piece's originator, director, librettist and animator.</p>

<p>To bring it to life/death, he worked with composer Cristobal Martinez (who also worked with Lea&ntilde;os on Frontera!), the Mariachi ensemble Los Cuatro Vientos, and artist Sean Levon Nash.</p>

<p>The animations in the opera have screened and won awards at national and international film festivals including Sundance, Cannes, and Morelia International Film Festival.</p>

<p>"Culture work is intended to elicit a response," Lea&ntilde;os affirmed. "We're creating art through the lens of culture so we can transform society and ourselves and work toward social justice."</p>
