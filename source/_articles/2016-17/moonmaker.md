The rotational forces on spinning heavenly spheres creates bulges at their equators. A faster spin exerts a stronger force and bigger bulges. However, the Earth's moon only rotates about once a month. So, for centuries, astronomers wondered: With so little spin, why the lemon shape?

Billions of years ago, the Moon was made of rock sheets floating on a sea of magma, said Ian Garrick-Bethell, assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz. The Moon's distorted shape resulted from the combined effects of early tidal forces on a hot Moon, plus rotational forces as the surface later cooled unevenly, according to his paper published in _Nature._

Garrick-Bethell drew insight from similar ideas about the shape of Europa, the cool and watery moon of Jupiter. A detailed topographical analysis of the Earth's moon, based on data from laser altimeters and studies of gravity-field perturbations, supported these conclusions. Also involved in the study was UC Santa Cruz professor of Earth and planetary sciences Francis Nimmo.

This work expanded on earlier studies, published in _Science_, which used tidal forces to explain unusual features on an area of the Moon called the farside highlands.
