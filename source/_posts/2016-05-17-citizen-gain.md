The term "denizen" is used to describe an inhabitant who is not a formal citizen, but not necessarily an undocumented immigrant either. It's a word that fits more than 60 million refugees who have fled their homelands, according to UN Refugee Agency data.

"What does it mean to be a denizen in a world that is organized around, and by, nation-states?" asked Catherine Ram&#237;rez, associate professor of Latin American and Latino studies and director of the Chicano/ Latino Research Center at UC Santa Cruz.

Such questions will be explored during a year-long "Non-citizenship" seminar, planned by Ram&#237;rez and four other UC Santa Cruz professors: Juan Poblete, literature; Felicity Amaya Schaeffer, feminist studies; Sylvanna Falc&#243;n, Latin American and Latino studies; and Steven McKay, sociology. The seminar is funded by a $175,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation John E. Sawyer Seminar on the Comparative Study of Cultures. 

Ram&#237;rez hopes to foster conversations across the borders of academic disciplines, geographical regions, and even time periods&mdash;by including historical perspectives as well as current events.
